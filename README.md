# bt-1
First development of BT concept

This project is designed to be a location tracker so you can see 
where you've travelled over the course of a day or night. To start tracking,
you'd just hit the play button, and when you stop you'd be able to see a map
of your locations, with any pictures you took overlaid on the map. It would be
a cool way to remember travelling or other fun times.

Currently, the tracking uses localStorage. THe end goal is to use a local database
that will sync with a remote database.
